Coursera Advisor is a no nonsense chrome extension that uses the reviews of other students to give a more accurate rating to the course, to save you time and money.

If you have been browsing coursera maybe you have thought `WOW! all courses have between 4.5 and 4.9 stars`, and they really do, but not all courses are that great, that's where Coursera Advisor comes in, with a single click you will know if the course is worth your time and effort, just check the new rating in parenthesis with a ![Coursera Advisor logo](images/verified_16.png) to the left of the Coursera original score.
